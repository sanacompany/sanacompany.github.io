## General notes | Conventions

* First, we use YARN, try to avoid yarn for dependencies management.
* Every SCSS class is written following the [BEM methodology](http://getbem.com/).
* Every SCSS class is **Mobile first**. What does this mean? The base SCSS code is for mobile. Every media query should be written for larger screens (screen-sm, screen-md, screen-lg, screen-xl).
* We use `SCSS lint`, you should install this gem in your computer: `gem install scss_lint`. [Gem website](https://github.com/sds/scss-lint).
